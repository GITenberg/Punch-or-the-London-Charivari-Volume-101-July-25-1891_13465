    <p><i>Tuesday, July 14</i>.&mdash;Madame NORDICA is not at her
    best as <i>Aïda</i>. It lacks colour&mdash;that is on the face
    and hands, where at least should be shown some more "colourable
    pretence" for being the daughter of so blackened a character as
    is her father <i>Amonasro</i>, played as a villain of the
    deepest dye by M. DEVOYOD. When the celebrated march was heard,
    the players didn't seem particularly strong in trumps, and the
    trumpets giving a somewhat "uncertain sound,"&mdash;a trifle
    husky, as if they'd caught cold,&mdash;somewhat marred the
    usually thrilling effect. Gorgeous scene; and RAVELLI the
    Reliable as <i>Radames</i> quite the success of the evening.
    Mlle. GUERCIA as <i>Amneris</i> seemed to have made up after an
    old steel plate in a bygone Book of Beauty. Where are those
    Books of Beauty now! And <i>The Keepsake</i>? Where the
    pseudo-Byronic poetry and the short stories by Mrs. NAMBY and
    Mr. PAMBY? But this is only a marginal note, not in the
    Operatic score. Signor ABRAMOFF was a powerful <i>Ramphis</i>,
    his make-up suggesting that his title would be more
    appropriately <i>Rumfiz</i>,&mdash;which would be an excellent
    Egyptian name. Very good House, but still suffering from
    reaction after Imperial visit, and not to recover itself till
    to-morrow, <i>Wednesday</i>, when the House is crowded with a
    brilliant audience to hear a brilliant performance of
    <i>Otello. The Grand Otello Co. Covent Garden, Limited</i>.
    Thoroughly artistic performance of <i>Iago</i> by M. MAUREL.
    His wicked "Credo" more diabolically malicious than ever it was
    at the Lyceum; an uncanny but distinctly striking effect. Then
    DRURIOLANUS ASTRONOMICUS gave us a scenic startler in the way
    of imitation meteoric effect. 'Twas on this wise: of course,
    neither DRURIOLANUS nor any other Manager can carry on an
    operatic season without stars, and so they are here, a galaxy
    of 'em, up above, on the "back cloth," as it is technically
    termed, shining brilliantly but spasmodically, strange portents
    in the operatic sky. Pity Astronomer Royal not here to see and
    note the fact. Next time <i>Otello</i> is given, if this
    atmospheric effect is to be repeated, the attendants in the
    lobbies might be permitted to supply powerful telescopes at a
    small fixed charge. But the greatest star of all is Madame
    ALBANI as <i>Desdemona</i>; a triumph dramatically and
    operatically. Her song in the last Act, the celebrated
    "<i>Willow Song</i>"&mdash;which of course no cricketer ought
    to miss hearing&mdash;was most beautifully and touchingly
    rendered. Those persons suffering from the heat of a crowded
    house, and dreading the difficulty of finding their "keb or
    kerridge" in good time, and who therefore quitted their seats
    before ALBANI sang the "<i>Willow Song</i>," must, perforce,
    sing the old refrain, "<i>O Willow, we have missed you!</i>"
    and go back for it whenever this Opera is played again. M. JEAN
    DE RESZKÉ was not, perhaps, quite up to his usual form, or his
    usual former self; but, for all that, he justified his
    responsibility as one of the largest shareholders in the Grand
    Otello Company, Limited. All things considered, and the last
    best thing being invariably quite the best, <i>Otello, or
    Symphonies in Black and White</i>, is about the biggest success
    of the season.</p>

    <p>SUPPLEMENTARY AND CORRECTIVE.&mdash;In his Jubilee Number
    Mr. PUNCH remarked, "Merely to mention <i>all</i> the bright
    pens and pencils which have occasionally contributed to my
    pages would occupy much space." And space then was limited. But
    among the "Great Unnamed" <i>should</i> assuredly have been
    mentioned W.H. WILLS, one of the originators of Mr. PUNCH's
    publication, CLEMENT SCOTT the flowing lyrist, and author of
    "The Cry of the Children," &amp;c., ASHBY STERRY of "Lazy
    Minstrel" fame, and "ROBERT," the genial garrulous "City
    Waiter," whilst the names of J.P. ("Dumb-Crambo") ATKINSON, and
    E.J. WHEELER, were omitted by the purest accident. The late
    H.J. BYRON contributed a series of papers. Mr. PUNCH hastens to
    put them&mdash;as he would gladly some others&mdash;"on the
    list," since, of no one of them, could it be truly said "he
    never would be missed." "HALBOT" was a misprint for "HABLÔT,"
    "MAGUIN HANNAY" should read "MAGINN, HANNAY, &amp;c.," and for
    "<i>GEORGE</i> SILVER" read "HENRY."</p>

    <h2>LEAVES FROM A CANDIDATE'S DIARY.</h2>

    <p><i>Wednesday, June 11th</i>.&mdash;Left Billsbury last
    Saturday, having in DICKY DIKES's words "broken the back of the
    blooming canvas." During my last night's round we went into a
    small house in one of the slums. The husband was out, but the
    wife and family were all gathered together in the back room.
    There were five children, ranging in age from ten down to two,
    and the mother looked the very picture of slatternly
    discomfort. We asked the usual questions, and I was just
    turning to go, when I heard a violent fit of convulsive
    coughing from a dark corner. The mother got up and went to the
    corner. I couldn't help following, and saw the most miserable
    spectacle I ever set eyes on. In a sort of cradle was lying the
    smallest, frailest and most absolutely pinched and colourless
    baby choking with every cough, and gasping horribly for breath.
    I don't know what I said, but the mother turned to DIKES and
    said, "He haven't much longer to cough. I shall want the
    undertakers for him soon." I asked her if nothing could be
    done, but she merely replied, "It'll be better so. We've too
    many mouths to feed without him." I couldn't stay longer after
    that, but fairly bolted out of the house.</p>

    <p>Our people are jubilant about our prospects. The canvas
    shows, they say, a steady increase in our favour, the
    registrations have been uniformly good, and, best of all, Sir
    THOMAS CHUBSON again voted and spoke on the wrong side, when
    the Billsbury Main Drainage Bill came on for Second Reading in
    the House the other day. Our point is of course that, if this
    scheme were carried out, there would be a great deal of work
    for Billsbury labourers, and, somehow or other, a large amount
    of money would be spent in the town. We have rubbed this well
    in at every meeting we have held lately, and found it a most
    effective point during the canvas. CHUBSON and the Radicals
    talk about a great increase of the rates which would follow on
    it; but we pooh-pooh this, and point out that the ultimate
    saving would be enormous, and that the health of the town must
    be benefited. They don't like the business at all, and feel
    they've made a mistake.</p>

    <p>Have been made on successive nights a Druid, a Forester, and
    a Loyal and Ancient Shepherd. All these three are Benefit
    Societies, and the mysteries of initiation into each are very
    similar. Colonel CHORKLE (who ought to have gone through the
    business long ago) was made a Druid with me. I never saw
    anybody so nervous. All the courage of all the CHORKLES seemed
    to have deserted him, and he trembled like a Volunteer aspen. I
    told Major WORBOYS on the following day that his Colonel, who I
    was sure might be trusted to face a hostile battery without
    flinching, had been very nervous when he was made a Druid.
    WORBOYS sneered, and said that he'd be willing to take his
    chance of CHORKLE's facing the battery or not, if CHORKLE would
    only learn to ride decently. "Give you my word of honour," said
    WORBOYS, "when the General inspected us last year, CHORKLE's
    horse ran away with him three times, and at last we had to
    march past without him. One of the tamest horses in the world,
    too. My boy JACK rides it constantly." But WORBOYS despises
    CHORKLE, and thinks he ought to command the regiment himself.
    He spread it all over Billsbury that CHORKLE was found hiding
    under a table when he was summoned to be initiated, and was
    dragged out screaming piteously for mercy.</p>

    <p>On my last morning I was interviewed by a deputation from
    the Billsbury Branch of The Women's Suffrage League. The
    deputation consisted of Mrs. BOSER, the President of the
    Branch, Miss AMY GINGELL, the Secretary, and two others. It was
    a trying business. Mrs. BOSER is the most formidable person I
    ever met. I felt like a babe in her hands after she had
    glowered at me for five minutes. Finally I found myself, rather
    to my own astonishment, promising to vote for a Women's
    Suffrage Bill, and adding that Mrs. BOSER's arguments had
    convinced me that justice had in this matter been too long
    denied to women, and that for my part, if elected, I should
    lose no opportunity of recording my vote on the side of women.
    They seemed pleased, but the <i>Meteor</i> of the next day had
    a frightful leader about the "shameful want of moral fibre in a
    Conservative Candidate who was thus content to put the whole
    Constitution into the melting-pot, if by so doing he could only
    secure a few stray votes, and get the help of the women in his
    coal-and-blanket expeditions."</p>

    Shall I make you put the tickets now?</p>

    <p><i>First Int. T.</i> Um, no. On second thoughts, I'd like to
    see one of your short Circular Tours for the English Lakes, or
    Wales, before I decide.</p>

    <p><i>Culchard</i> (<i>to himself</i>). No sign of him yet! I
    <i>do</i> like a man to keep an appointment. If this is the way
    he <i>begins</i>&mdash;I have my doubts whether he is
    <i>quite</i> the sort of fellow to&mdash;but I took the
    precaution to ask HUGH ROSE about him, and ROSE said he was the
    best company in the world, and I couldn't help getting on with
    him. I don't think ROSE would deceive me. And from all I've
    seen of PODBURY, he seems a pleasant fellow enough. What a
    Babel! All these people bent on pleasure, going to seek it in
    as many directions&mdash;with what success no one can predict.
    There's an idea for a sonnet there.</p>

    'em, and what I want <i>you</i> should do now is to instruct

    <p><i>The A.C.</i> But hold on&mdash;how'm I goin' to write to
    that sharp, when I've lost his address, and disremember his
    name? Can't you mail a few particulars to your agent, so he'll
    identify him? No. (<i>Disappointed.</i>) Well, I thought you'd
    ha' fixed up a little thing like that, anyhow; in my country
    they'd ha' done it right away. Yes, <i>Sir</i>! [<i>He goes

    <p><i>Podbury</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Just nicked
    it!&mdash;(<i>looks at clock</i>)&mdash;more or less. And he
    doesn't seem to have turned up yet. Wonder how we shall hit it
    off together. HUGHIE ROSE said he was a capital good
    chap&mdash;when you once got over his manner. Anyhow, it's a
    great tip to go abroad with a fellow who knows the ropes.
    (<i>Suddenly sees</i> CULCHARD <i>absorbed in his
    note-book.</i>) So <i>here</i> you are, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Culchard</i> (<i>slightly scandalised by the tweeds and
    the brown boots</i>). Yes, I've been here some little time. I
    wish you could have managed to come before, because they close
    early here to-day, and I wanted to go thoroughly over the tour
    I sketched out before getting the tickets. [<i>He produces an
    elaborate outline.</i></p>

    <p><i>Podbury</i> (<i>easily</i>). Oh, <i>that's</i> all right!
    I don't care where <i>I</i> go! All I want is, to see as much
    as we can in the time&mdash;leave all the rest to you. I'll sit
    here while you get the tickets.</p>

    <p><i>An Old Lady</i> (<i>to Clerk, as</i> CULCHARD) <i>is
    waiting at the counter</i>). Oh, I <i>beg</i> your pardon, but
    <i>could</i> you inform me if the 1'55 train from Calais to
    Basle stops long enough for refreshments anywhere, and when
    they examine the luggage, and if I can leave my handbag in the
    carriage, and whether there is an English service at Yodeldorf,
    and is it held in the hotel, and Evangelical, or High Church,
    and are the sittings free, and what Hymn-book they use?</p>

    <blockquote>

    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Culchard</i> (<i>returning to</i> PODBURY <i>with two
    cases bulging with books of coloured coupons</i>). Here are
    yours. I should like you to run your eye over them, and see
    that they are correct, if you don't mind.</p>

    <p><i>Podbury</i> (<i>stuffing them in his pocket</i>). Can't
    be bothered now. Take your word for it.</p>

             alt="Yes, Sir!" /></a>Yes, Sir!
    </div>

    <p><i>Culchard</i>. No&mdash;but considering that we start the
    first thing to-morrow morning, wouldn't it be as well to have
    some idea of where you're going? And, by the way, excuse me,
    but is it altogether prudent to keep your tickets in an outside
    pocket like that? I always keep mine, with my money, in a
    special case in an inner pocket, with a buttoned nap&mdash;then
    I know I <i>can't</i> lose them.</p>

    <p><i>Podbury</i>. Anything for a quiet life! (<i>He examines
    his coupons.</i>) Dover to Ostend? Never been there&mdash;like
    to see what Ostend's like. But why didn't you go by
    Calais?&mdash;<i>shorter</i> you know.</p>

    <p><i>Culchard</i>. Because I thought we'd see Bruges and Ghent
    on our way to Brussels.</p>

    <p><i>Podbury</i>. Bruges, eh? Capital! Anything particular
    going on there? No? It don't matter. And Ghent&mdash;let's see,
    wasn't that where they brought the good news to? Yes, we'll
    stop at Ghent&mdash;if we've time. Then&mdash;Brussels? Good
    deal of work to be done there, I suppose, sightseeing, and
    that? I like a place where you can moon about without being
    bothered myself; now, at <i>Brussels</i>&mdash;never mind, I
    was only thinking.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> It's the best place to get to Cologne and up
    the Rhine from. Then, you see, we go rather out of our way to
    Nuremberg&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Podbury</i>. Where they make toys? <i>I</i>
    know&mdash;pretty festive there, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> I don't know about festive&mdash;but it
    is&mdash;er&mdash;a quaint, and highly interesting old place.
    Then I thought we'd dip down to Constance, and strike across
    the Alps to the Italian Lakes.</p>

    <p><i>Podbury</i>. Italian Lakes? First&mdash;rate! Yes,
    <i>they</i>'re worth seeing, I suppose. Think they're better
    than the <i>Swiss</i> ones, though?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>tolerantly</i>). I can get the coupons
    changed for Switzerland, if you prefer it. The Swiss Lakes may
    be the more picturesque.</p>

    <p><i>Podbury</i>. Yes, we'll do Switzerland&mdash;and run back
    by Paris, eh? Not much to do in Switzerland, though, after
    all!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>with a faintly superior smile</i>). There
    are one or two mountains, I believe. But, personally, I should
    prefer Italy.</p>

    <p><i>Podbury</i>. So should I. No fun in
    mountains&mdash;unless you go up 'em. What do you think of
    choosing some quiet place, where nobody ever goes&mdash;say in
    France or Germany&mdash;and, sticking to <i>that</i>. More of a
    rest, wouldn't it be? such a bore having to know a lot; of
    people!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> I don't see how we can change <i>all</i> the
    tickets, really. If you like, we could stop a week at St.
    Goarshausen.</p>

    <p><i>Podbury</i>. What's St. Goarshausen
    like&mdash;cheery?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> I understood the idea was to keep away from
    our fellow countrymen, and as far as I can remember St.
    Goarshausen, it is not overrun with tourists&mdash;we should be
    quiet enough
    <i>there</i>.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41"
       id="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span>

    <p><i>Podbury</i>. That's the place for <i>me</i>, then. Or
    could we push on to Vienna? Never seen Vienna.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> If you like to give up Italy altogether.</p>

    <p><i>Podbury</i>. What do you say to <i>beginning</i> with
    Italy and working back? Too hot, eh? Well, then, we'll let
    things be as they are&mdash;I daresay it will do well enough.
    So <i>that's</i> settled!</p>

    <p><i>Culchard</i> (<i>to himself on parting, after final
    arrangements concluded</i>). I wish ROSE had warned me that
    PODBURY's habit of mind was so painfully desultory. (<i>He
    sighs.</i>) However&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Podbury</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Wonder now long I shall
    take to get over CULCHARD's manner. (<i>He sighs.</i>) I wish
    old HUGHIE was coming&mdash;he'd give me a leg over!</p>

    </div>

    <p>I pause in my communications. Friends, real friends, have
    wired over accounts of me on the trip, which have not been
    written by "friendlies." Somebody wrote to <i>Black and
    White</i> what purported to be Notes about me aboard the
    gallant <i>Grantully Castle</i>, than which a better-found
    vessel&mdash;"found" is the word&mdash;never put to sea. This
    somebody ("bless him!"&mdash;DR-MM-ND W-LFF will know what I
    mean) observes that "he didn't notice" any particular gratitude
    on my part towards Captain HAY and his talented assistants.
    Hay! what? why, confound them, I was all gratitude! Is it
    because I did not run at him, embrace him, and shake his arms
    off, that therefore I did not <i>feel</i> grateful! I was
    awfully grateful. I felt inclined to alter the name of the
    vessel to the <i>Gratefully</i> <i>Castle</i>. But "she" (you
    always call a vessel "she"&mdash;isn't that nautical?) "is" as
    the song says "another's, and never can be mine!" so I can't
    change her name. I was overpowered by my feelings&mdash;and
    what does that mean but the swallowing, with a gurgle in the
    throat, of the silent tear, and the avoidance of the topic
    uppermost in one's mind at the moment.</p>

    <p>"The soldier leant upon his sword, and wiped away a
    tear"&mdash;but the sailor didn't, <i>Verb. sap.</i> What did I
    do? Why, in my note of notes, my Private Diary, I made this
    mem., "<i>Make Hay while the sun shines.</i>" Now what, I ask
    any unprejudiced person, what does this mean? If Captain HAY
    were suddenly to be promoted in the hay-day of his valuable
    career to be an Admiral, would he suspect that he owed this
    elevation to the man who, strictly obeying the ship's orders,
    <i>never even spoke to the man at the wheel</i>? Now to come to
    the next point. This correspondent girds at my having had a
    special cabin and a special steward. <i>Why!</i> the envious
    grumbler! if he had been as specially unwell as I was&mdash;but
    there, I own I lose patience with him&mdash;didn't I go out as
    a "Special," and if a Special doesn't have everything special
    about him, <i>he is simply obtaining money under false
    pretences</i>. I've a great mind&mdash;I hear the jeerer
    snigger in his sleeve&mdash;but I repeat emphatically I have a
    great mind to come back. "He will return, I know him well," my
    traducers may sing; and I shall return when I consider my
    special work specially done in my own special manner, and be
    blowed to em all, the detractors!</p>

    <p>He grumbles because I had <i>a special portable light</i>
    all to myself, "when I wanted to play cards." Aha! do we see
    the cloven hoof now? Was I to play cards <i>in the dark</i>?
    Those who know me best know that I am all fair and above-board,
    and no hole-and-corner gambling for me. And what tale has he to
    tell? Why that "<i>Another night, not using his special light
    at the time, two other passengers began a game of chess under
    its rays.</i>" Which they had no right whatever to do. But I
    winked at it, and when the first officer was coming his rounds
    I winked at <i>them</i>; but this friendly act on my part they
    did not heed, and consequently <i>to save them from being put
    in irons</i> and confined in the deepest dungeon beneath the
    <i>Grantully Castle</i> moat, I "<i>came along just then</i>,"
    as he reports, "<i>and removed the lamp to another part of the
    deck, leaving the chess-players in the dark</i>"&mdash;as if
    this consequence were anything extraordinary when a lamp is
    removed! Why any schoolboy, the merest tyro in Scripture
    History, knows where the great Hebrew Lawgiver was <i>when the
    candle went out</i>. And were these passengers to be exempt
    from the action of Nature's ordinary laws!
    Bah!&mdash;"<i>without a word of apology or explanation</i>." I
    <i>had</i> winked, but they were worse than blind horses, and
    more resembled the inferior quadruped in obstinately refusing
    to move, or in subsequently acknowledging this act of
    thoughtful kindness on my part.</p>

    <p>As to my eating for breakfast a flying-fish, which somebody
    on board had caught and given me, all I ask is, <i>why
    shouldn't I?</i> I never had eaten a flying-fish before, and I
    don't think I ever shall again. If the gentleman who caught it
    didn't want me to eat it, he should have said so: for there
    were three courses open to him; viz., <i>first</i>, to refuse
    to give it me; <i>secondly</i>, to give it me on condition that
    I kept it in memory of the occasion; <i>thirdly</i>, to throw
    it back into the sea. But there was only one course open to
    <i>me</i> when I got it, and that was the first course at
    breakfast; the second course was kidgeree. It was a small fish
    <i>just enough for one</i>, and now I rather fancy I remember
    this <i>Black and White</i> correspondent, for it must have
    been he, coming to my table, eyeing the fish, smacking his
    lips, and observing that <i>he</i> "had never had the chance of
    tasting a fried flying-fish." At that moment I was just
    finishing the tail (a sweet morsel and not the worst part by
    any means), and there was nothing left to offer him. So he went
    away disappointed, with a grudge against yours truly. This,
    Sir, is the true tale of the flying-fish, and if it isn't, let
    me hear the revised version from my aspersers and caluminators.
    I can write no more to-day. I am boiling over, and must go and
    kick somebody. Yours, &amp;c.,

    <h2>A SHILLING IN THE POUND WISE.</h2>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;As the School Board rate has already
    touched a shilling, and seems likely to go even higher, why
    should not some of our money be expended in teaching the young
    idea of the lower classes how to develop into more valuable
    citizens than they seem likely to become under present
    conditions? To carry out this idea, I jot down a few questions
    to be put to a School-Board scholar before the granting of the
    customary certificates:&mdash;</p>

    <p>1. Describe the formation of a Regiment, and explain its
    position and duties in Brigade.</p>

    <p>2. What are the duties of a Special Constable?</p>

    <p>3. How would you set about putting horses into a
    fire-engine?</p>

    <p>4. Describe the process of resuscitating a person apparently
    drowned. How would you revive a person rendered insensible by
    (1) cold, (2) by sunstroke.</p>

    <p>5. Give simple remedies to be applied at once in case of
    bites by a mad dog, accidental poisoning by arsenic, and
    swallowing of spurious coin.</p>

    <p>6. How would you set, (1) a leg, (2) an arm, (3) a broken
    finger? If a man is run over by a Hansom, what should you do?
    Describe an excellent substitute for a litter, when you can
    obtain nothing better.</p>

    <p>7. State shortly what you consider your duty would be, (1)
    were the country invaded, (2) were London in the hands of the
    mob, (3) were your neighbourhood visited by fire, and decimated
    by the plague.</p>

    <p>There, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, if every School-Board scholar could
    supply satisfactory answers to the above questions, I would not
    grudge my shilling in the pound&mdash;nay, possibly look with
    equanimity on eighteenpence!&mdash;Yours, cordially,</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, July</i> 13. Emperor WILLIAM
    leaves to-day having taken affectionate farewell of Grandmamma.
    On the whole been most successful visit. Weather a little
    Frenchy in its tendency, but not all rain and thunder. If
    things could only have been kept comfortable to last moment
    there need have been nothing to mar success of event.
    Unfortunately, TANNER's active brain discovered opportunity of
    casting a stone at head of departing EMPEROR. Looking in at
    Charing Cross Telegraph Office, intending to send
    sixpenny-worth of genial remark to his late esteemed Leader
    PARNELL on result of Carlow election, TANNER observed
    "Gutknecht" on shaft of lead pencil gratuitously provided. Much
    puzzled at this; thought at first it was RAIKES's way of
    spelling good night; found on inquiry it was German.</p>

    <p>TANNER's patriotic bosom filled with storm of indignation.
    "What!" he cried, apostrophising the absent RAIKES, "at a time
    when trade is declining, Ireland is unhappy, strikes are
    rampant, and human misery seems to have reached its bitterest
    point, at such a time it might be hoped you would have given up
    your days and nights to ameliorating the common lot, instead of
    which you go about importing lead pencils made in Germany, and
    so taking the very bread out of the mouth of the British
    Workman."</p>

    <p>Might have asked question on subject a week ago when he made
    discovery; adroitly put it down for to-night; and so whilst
    Emperor WILLIAM was taking leave of Grandmamma in the stately
    halls of Windsor, TANNER was flinging a lead pencil at his
    retreating figure, stabbing him, so to speak, in the Imperial
    back with a commercial product retailed at the inconsiderable
    price of twopence-halfpenny a dozen.</p>

    <p>With some sense of relief House got into Committee of
    Supply. Various questions brought up on Colonial Vote. P. and
    O. SUTHERLAND championed claims of Singapore for deliverance
    from arbitrary conduct of Government in levying military
    contributions. Doesn't often take part in Debate; showed
    to-night that abstention is not due to lack of debating
    faculty. Set forth case of his clients in clear business-like
    speech, which commanded attention of audience, for whom topic
    itself not particularly attractive.</p>

    <p>"SUTHERLAND," said the Member for Sark, one of his most
    attentive listeners, "has introduced a new element into
    Parliamentary oratory. His intercurrent cough is the most
    remarkable adjunct to oratory I ever heard. Suppose the fact
    is, when he pauses, he is thinking over the next word, or
    surveying for a new line of argument. Other men would consult
    their notes. P. and O. indulges in a kind of clearing of his
    throat, a compromise between a cough and an articulate
    remark&mdash;commanding, conciliatory, threatening, beseeching,
    or convincing, according as the exigencies of the moment
    require. As a work of art, the only contemporary thing equal to
    it that I know, and that, of course, in quite a different way,
    is some of the bye-play of the old gentleman in <i>L'Enfant
    Prodigue</i>."</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;In Committee of Supply.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;Met CHAPLIN just now, striding along
    corridor, mopping his statesmanlike brow with a bandana that
    would, on emergency, serve as foresail for one of the
    cattle-carrying steamers just now troubling the Minister for
    Agriculture.</p>

    <p>"Anything gone wrong?" I asked, for it was impossible to be
    blind to his evident trepidation.</p>

    <p>"No, dear boy, it's all right as it turns out, but it might
    have been otherwise. What do you think? LABBY's positively been
    moving the reduction of the Vote by the amount of my salary!
    Shouldn't have been surprised if some Member had got up, and,
    in neat speech, dilating on the enormous forward strides made
    by the Empire since Ministry of Agriculture was created, moved
    to double my screw. But to go and propose to dock it altogether
    at the end of the first year is, if I may say so, not
    encouraging."</p>

    <p>"Oh," I said, "you mustn't mind SAGE of QUEEN ANNE'S GATE;
    his bark is worse than his bite."</p>

    <p>"Yes, I know," said CHAPLIN; "but I should be obliged to him
    if he'd bark at someone else's heels. Not, mind you, that I
    care so much about the money question. Between you and me
    (though don't let it go further, or they might be holding me to
    my bargain), I would rather pay £2000 a year than not have a
    seat on the Treasury Bench in charge of a department. You've
    never tasted the delight of standing up in a full House and
    reading out answer to a question, whilst all the world hangs on
    your lips. Nor have you ever drunk the deep delight of
    explaining a Bill, or replying on behalf of HER MAJESTY's
    Government to an Amendment. The joy is all the greater to me,
    since it is newly acquired. For years I sat below the Gangway,
    striving to catch the SPEAKER's eye in competition with the
    herd, and when I succeeded Members either howled at me or left
    the House. Now I speak without waiting for the SPEAKER's call,
    and the House listens attentively to the utterances of the
    Minister for Agriculture. That's better than salary paid
    quarterly: worth paying for as I say. Still it's not pleasant
    to have LABBY seriously proposing to stop your wages. Wish he'd
    try it on someone else. There's PLUNKET for example; must put
    him up in that quarter."</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;A long dull night varied by
    occasional squalls. An immense relief to Hon. Members, after
    sitting through an hour discussing Alienation of Crown Rights
    in Salmon Fishing in Scotland, on which CALDWELL delivers
    discourse, to have opportunity of exercising their lungs.
    MORTON a benefactor in this respect. As soon as ALPHEUS
    CLEOPHAS is discovered on his feet there goes forth a howl that
    shakes the building. To-night rather awkward circumstance
    followed. ALPHEUS CLEOPHAS rising for the eighth time, Members
    broke forth into agonised howl that lasted several minutes. Was
    stopped by sudden commotion
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"
       id="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span> at the Bar. Engineer PRIM
       rushed wildly in, gesticulating towards the astonished
       Chair, and disappeared. A body of workmen appearing
       mysteriously from depths beneath House, tumultuously crossed
       the doorway, and also vanished. Presently news came that
       flood of water was raging down staircase; gradually truth
       got at; a large water-main had burst in Upper Committee
       Corridor; cracked at startling sound of outburst upon
       ALPHEUS CLEOPHAS's re-appearance.</p>

    <p>"This is all very well," said PLUNKET. "I am myself no
    enthusiastic admirer of MORTON's Parliamentary eloquence.
    Still, as First Commissioner of Works, I feel this thing must
    be discouraged. Must draw the line somewhere. Can't have our
    water-mains bursting with vicarious indignation because MORTON
    would speak eight times in Committee of Supply."</p>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;In Lords to-night, STANLEY OF ALDERLEY,
    L.C.C., gave fresh advertisement to CALDERON's picture, "<i>St.
    Elizabeth of Hungary.</i>" Not a pleasant subject, from any
    point of view, artistic or moral. Everybody but well-meaning
    people like STANLEY OF ALDERLEY, glad to drop it. He brings it
    forward at this late day; tries to make the MARKISS responsible
    for whole business. The MARKISS protests that STANLEY has had
    the advantage of him; hasn't even seen the picture. "The only
    idea I have been able to form of it," he said to delighted
    House, "is derived from a picture in <i>Punch</i>, in which
    <i>ZÆO</i> is showing her back to the Members of the County
    Council." Lords don't often indulge in hearty laughter; this
    too much for them, and STANLEY OF ALDERLEY temporarily
    extinguished, amid almost uproarious mirth.</p>

    <h2>MONTI THE MATADOR.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Originally intended for the F-rtn-ghtly
    R-v-w.</i>)</h4>

    <p>"Yes, I'm better, and the Doctor tells me I've escaped once
    more. That Doctor hates you&mdash;I know it. He has saved
    me&mdash;to tell you the story&mdash;The story <i>I</i> have
    been trying to tell to some one for thirty years."</p>

    <p>I was talking to Old MONTI, whose full name was MONTI DI
    PIETA&mdash;as a pledge of his respectability. He was a
    descendant of the Pornbrocheros del Treballos d'Oro. He was
    subsequently called Monkey&mdash;as a tribute to his
    character.</p>

    <p>"I should like you to tell me," I said, "for you must know
    that for years I have seen the snows on the Lagartigo, and the
    moonlight on the&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Stop!" he cried&mdash;"you are going to begin padding. That
    will do for a magazine, not for me!" and he snapped his fingers
    at me.</p>

    <p>But I was not to be put off. He was weak&mdash;a
    cripple&mdash;and I gave him the choice of listening to a
    personally-conducted tour in the South of Spain, or relating
    his adventures.</p>

    <p>"I will have my revenge!" he muttered. "You shall hear my
    life from the beginning. You must know, then, that sixty years
    ago I was born, and&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Yes," I returned, interrupting him&mdash;"of poor parents.
    Your father was coarse, your mother pious. You learned all you
    could about bulls, which you kept from your father, and you
    were ultimately engaged as a bull-fighter&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Stop, stop!" he cried. "If you cut out about a dozen pages
    of my biography, at least let me explain how I saved my father.
    You must know&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"I will do it for you in a line," I said, sharply. "Your
    father lost his temper, and tried bullying the bull (no joke),
    and you winked at the animal. He knew you, and stood still. The
    bull went for your father&mdash;you for the bull. Drive
    on!"</p>

    <p>"Let me tell you then, how I prepared myself for the Ring by
    practising on a dummy bull.&mdash;I had no difficulty in
    sticking pins into it&mdash;it was quite calm. Then I tried the
    same game on a sheep, and got knocked down for my pains! One of
    my monkey tricks! Then I got acquainted with some Irish bulls,
    and letting them off on my friends got several thumps on the
    head."</p>

    <p>"No," I interrupted him sternly, "get on with your
    story."</p>

    <p>"Well, at length I met JUAN at the beginning of May."</p>

    <p>"Make it first of April," I said, severely.</p>

    <p>"He was the Toreador out of <i>Carmen</i>, to put it
    shortly," he continued, not deigning to notice my
    interruption&mdash;"and he introduced me to the bull-fight. Of
    course I had to pay my footing (a very uncertain one) in
    <i>duros</i>, or hard cash. Then every morning I ate a
    <i>chuto</i> (a sort of small cabbage) at my dinner&mdash;then
    they tried me as a <i>capa</i>, to test (so they said) my
    capability. The chief patron was the Duke of MEDICINA, who in
    early youth had been a doctor&mdash;hence his title&mdash;and I
    shall never forget his first greeting."</p>

    <p>"Your story!" I interrupted, sternly, finding that the old
    man was once more becoming tedious.</p>

    <p>"I returned," replied the dotard, with a senile chuckle,
    "that he was wrong. His answer was beyond my meaning&mdash;he
    muttered something about 'mutton and <i>capa</i> sauce.' I was
    engaged," continued the dotard, with a feeble grin, "as a
    <i>capa</i> for seventy years certain, with an annual benefit
    once in four years, with a salary of forty-two thousand a
    year&mdash;which in those days seemed to me to be a small
    fortune."</p>

             alt="'They made an Idol of me.'" /></a>"They made an
             Idol of me."
    </div>

    <p>"They are wretchedly paid in Spain," I observed.</p>

    <p>"They are," he acquiesced. "I was paid a week in advance,
    and have lived upon the proceeds ever since. And now my life
    was indeed a merry one. I was free of the Ring. Now I played
    the cornet in the <i>Brassos Banderillos</i>, and my
    performance pleased the <i>aficionados</i> (or advertising
    agents) so well, that my name was known throughout the
    Peninsula."</p>

    <p>"Well," once more I interrupted, "I suppose you met a
    Spanish beauty, fell in love with her, and was cut out by a
    party of the name of JUAN?"</p>

    <p>"However do you think of such clever things?" asked the old
    man, in a tone of extreme astonishment. "But you are right. I
    placed CLEMENCIA one day in the <i>pal co</i> (or part reserved
    for friends), and the bull tossed me. Ah, she trampled upon
    me&mdash;treated me like a mat. But I loved her and adored
    myself. Hence I was called a 'Mat-Adorer.' I repeat, the bull
    tossed me, and I did not come down heads."</p>

    <p>"Go on."</p>

    <p>"I was ill, and neglected, but soon recovered sufficiently
    to kill sixty-six bulls in succession."</p>

    <p>"Surely you are exaggerating?"</p>

    <p>"You are perfectly right," he answered, with a blush. "I
    killed sixty-five&mdash;the sixty-sixth was only mortally
    wounded. And now the people made an idol of me. I was
    absolutely worshipped"&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Come to the point," I said, in a tone that showed I was not
    to be trifled with.</p>

    <p>"No <i>that</i> was the fate of JUAN. At the end of a game
    of <i>toros</i> (which is Spanish for marbles) he said to me
    (in excellent Spanish), 'MONTI, me bhoy, philaloo! ye will
    shtay by me?' 'That will I&mdash;as shure as me name is
    TIM&mdash;I should say MONTI,' I responded, in choice
    Castilian. The bull came up, I looked him in the eye, raised my
    <i>shillalo</i> (a short Spanish club), and, crying 'Whist!' he
    cut for partners. JUAN was cut a deal."</p>

    <p>"That bull was a ripper," I murmured.</p>

    <p>"Bedad he was that, Sorr," returned the dotard, whose
    Spanish became more and more Castilian every moment. "CLEMENICA
    died the next morning. But I am remorseful&mdash;that I did not
    kill her myself. And now I have had my revenge! I have told ye
    the story! I know you&mdash;your name's H-A-R-"&mdash;</p>

    <p>He gave a gasp and died.</p>

    <p>But I too had <i>my</i> revenge. I sent the tale I had just
    heard to the <i>F-rtn-ghtly R-v-w</i>.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
